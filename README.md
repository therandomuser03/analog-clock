# Analog Clock using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

My first project to seperate the HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes to build an analog clock along with the CSS Glassmorphism Card effect.

Also, this is my first try to fix the resolution of the background image so that both the users (PC & Mobile) can view this page properly.
